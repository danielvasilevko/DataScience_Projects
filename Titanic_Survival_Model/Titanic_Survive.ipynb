    "The sinking of the Titanic is one the most well known events in human history. Boasting both pop-culture significance and historical relevance there are likely thousands if not millions of people who have asked the question; \"Would I survive the Titanic?\" While we have no way to go back in time and see for ourselves we thankfully have the second best thing: data. More specifically data on the passengers. We know who they were, where they stayed and most importantly if they survived. Let's take a look at this historical demographic battle royal and see what kind of person was most likely to survive the Titanic."
